## 1. Data Preparation

- using pandas to read csv and view dataset shape and columns
- create new dataset using relevant features and target variable for the present task

## 2. Data Visualization

- check datatypes in case there is need for encoding categorical values
- check for missing values and duplicate rows
- check correlation coefficient of features to the target variable using seaborn
- create new dataset using highly correlated features

## 3. Model Training

- split data into training and test sets using scikit-learn
- create linear regression model from the data
- check model summary (coefficients and r-squared value)

## 4. Model Evaluation

- use the model to create predictions
- compare predictions to test set values using matplotlib
- use r2_score from scikit-learn to check model accuracy

## 5. Model Explanation

- explanation for model's predictions and accuracy
